## 📖 Overview

### The Problem
When you visit a walk-in or Family Clinic, there are cases of significant wait times. Doctors get barely 15 minutes to see the patient with very less time to gather complete information, history and assessment.
Doctors currently spend up to 50% of their time on data entry and basic history gathering. When they try to save time by conversing directly with patients, they may lose track of important information needed to maintain proper medical histories. This leads to:
- Physician burnout
- Incomplete or incorrect information storage
- Shorter, rushed patient visits
- Critical symptoms being missed

### The Solution
MediScreen AI is a multi-agent system that acts as a "pre-visit" medical screener. It interviews patients before they enter the exam room, intelligently gathering symptoms, cross-referencing their medical history (via MCP), and generating a professional S.O.A.P. (Subjective, Objective, Assessment and Plan) note for the doctor.

### Real-World Impact

**Efficiency:** Saves 5-7 minutes per patient visit (out of typical 15-minute appointments)

**Quality:** Ensures comprehensive history taking without feeling rushed. Gives patients the ability to describe all their symptoms without hesitation.

**Safety:** Provides a standardized, written brief for the doctor to review.

## 🗺️ Architecture

MediScreen AI uses a Hub-and-Spoke Multi-Agent Architecture powered by the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

![MediScreen AI architecture diagram showing a hub-and-spoke multi-agent system: primary subjects are a Patient (User), an Intake Coordinator Agent, a Symptom Specialist Agent, a History Archivist Agent, a Patient Data Server labeled MCPServer, a Clinical Scribe Agent, and a Doctor reviewing the output. The Patient chats with the Intake Coordinator Agent (label Chat). The Intake Coordinator delegates interviews to the Symptom Specialist Agent (label Delegates Interview) and fetches records from the History Archivist Agent (label Fetches Data). The History Archivist connects to the Patient Data Server via the Model Context Protocol MCP (label MCP Protocol). The Intake sends raw logs to the Clinical Scribe (label Sends Raw Logs). The Clinical Scribe returns a SOAP Note for the Doctor to review (label Returns SOAP Note). The image is a schematic flowchart with labeled boxes and directional arrows, set in a clinical technical environment with a professional, informative tone.](/assets/MediScreen_Arch_light.jpg)



### The Agent Team

**Intake Coordinator (MCP Host):** The "Front Desk" - Manages the session, routes tasks, and maintains context.

**Symptom Specialist:** A reasoning agent that conducts "drill-down" interviews based on specific complaints (e.g., dynamic questions for "headache" vs. "fever").

**History Archivist:** A tool-using agent that connects to our secure MCP Server to fetch patient records without hallucinating.

**Clinical Scribe:** A back-office agent that synthesizes raw chat logs into professional medical notes using Context Engineering.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- A Google Cloud Project with Google AI Studio Key (recommended)
- VS Code (recommended for MCP development)

### Installation

**1. Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/curiousravi/MediScreen-AI.git
cd mediscreen-ai
```

**2. Install Dependencies**

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**3. Configure Environment**

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

### Usage

**Run the System:**

```bash
python -m src.main
```

This command launches both the Agent Client and the local MCP Server automatically.

**Demo Flow:**

1. **Login:** Enter Patient ID `PT-1001` (Jane Doe) or `PT-1002` (John Smith)
2. **Complaint:** State a symptom (e.g., "I have a migraine")
3. **Interview:** The SymptomSpecialist will take over and ask follow-up questions
4. **Result:** The system will generate a final S.O.A.P. Note in the terminal

## 🌟 Features & Enhancements

### 1. Persistent Storage (SQLite)
Patient data and session information stored locally for Context.

### 2. Observability & Logging

**Logs Location:** 
- `logs/agent_trace_yyyy-mm-dd.log`
- `logs/Patient_SOAP_NOTE_yyyy-mm-dd_hhmmss.txt`

**What is logged:**
- Agent start/stop events
- Raw Model Inputs/Outputs
- Tool execution (MCP calls)
- Errors and Exceptions
- Scribe Summary notes, post completion

---

## 🔮 Future Roadmap: UI Integration

Currently, MediScreen AI operates via a CLI, but it is designed as an **API-First Backend**.

**Proposed Integration:**
- The IntakeCoordinator can be wrapped in a FastAPI websocket endpoint
- **Frontend:** A React Native mobile app or hospital tablet interface (Streamlit) can connect to this endpoint
- **Hospital System:** The MCP Server (`history_server.py`) is designed to be swapped. In production, it would connect to a real FHIR-compliant database (e.g., Epic or Cerner) without changing the agent code.

## 🛡️ Ethics & Safety

### Mock Data Only
This project uses entirely **synthetic data** (`mock_patients.json`). No real Patient Health Information (PHI) is used or stored.

### No Diagnosis
The system prompt explicitly forbids agents from offering medical diagnoses. It is strictly a **documentation and intake tool**.

### Intended Use
- **Educational purposes**: Learning about multi-agent AI systems
- **Research purposes**: Exploring healthcare AI applications
- **Demonstration purposes**: Showcasing MCP integration
- **NOT for clinical use**: Must not be used for actual patient care

### Production Deployment Considerations
If adapting this project for real-world use, you must:
- Implement proper HIPAA compliance measures
- Obtain necessary medical device certifications if required
- Conduct clinical validation studies
- Implement robust security and encryption
- Ensure proper consent and privacy controls
- Consult with healthcare legal and compliance experts
